# Eika shopping list, now with tests ;)

Here we are!

This is the Eika's shopping list, an app that helps you save the items you want to purchase during the (~~infinite~~) walk inside Eika.

It is a **mobile first page**, so please check it out first with your mobile or a mobile screen option in your browser.
